/*

This project analyzes the Video Games Sales as at 22 Dec 2016 dataset using SQL.
The goal is to explore sales performance and critical reception through six analytical objectives â€” ranking top-selling games, identifying publisher, platform, and genre shares, and finding games with the highest critic scores.
It demonstrates how SQL can be used for descriptive data analysis and insights generation.

1st Objective - Rank the ten best-selling games.
2nd Objective - Identify how much each publisher represents in the sample (in%)
3rd Objective - Identify how much each platform represents in the sample (in%)
4th Objective - Identify how much each genre represents in the sample (in%) 
5th Objective - Identify the top 5 best-selling games with the highest critic scores    
6th Objective - Identify the game with the highest critic score
