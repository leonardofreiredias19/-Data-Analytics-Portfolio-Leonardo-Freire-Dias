# ðŸ“Š Data Analytics Portfolio | LÃ©o Dias

Welcome to my Data Analytics project portfolio. This repository serves as a central hub for my scripts, analyses, and solutions focused on transforming data into business insights and effective strategies.

## ðŸš€ Featured Project: Video Game Sales Analysis (SQL)

This is the first project published here. It demonstrates how SQL can be used for descriptive analysis and generating insights from large datasets.

| Objective | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Focus** | Sales Analysis, Market Share (Publisher, Platform, Genre), and Correlation with Critic Scores. |
| **Technology** | SQL (Queries, Joins, Aggregations, Ranking). |
| **File** | The complete script is available in `Case_Sales_Video_Games.sql`. |

### ðŸŒ± Next Steps
I plan to regularly add new analysis scripts with a focus on Business Analytics, Economic Data Modeling, and Data Storytelling.
